# üìò Java Testing and Logging Exercises

This repository contains hands-on exercises focusing on three essential areas of Java development:

- ‚úÖ JUnit Testing (Basic & Advanced)
- üîç Mockito for Mocking & Verification
- ü™µ SLF4J Logging with Logback

Each section includes a brief description of the objectives and placeholders to attach your output screenshots. Please replace the placeholder image tags with your actual screenshots.
