# ðŸ“˜ React Events Hands-on Lab

This document introduces the event system in React, including the concept of synthetic events, event handlers, and Reactâ€™s naming conventions for events. This will help developers handle user interactions like clicks, form submissions, and keyboard actions in a React-friendly way.

## ðŸ”¹ React Events Overview

In React, events are triggered just like in HTML (e.g., onClick, onChange), but are handled differently behind the scenes using a cross-browser wrapper called the SyntheticEvent.

```javascript
function handleClick() {
  alert("Button was clicked!");
}

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
```

React normalizes events to ensure consistent behavior across all browsers.

Events can be added to any JSX element.

## ðŸ”¹ Event Handlers in React

Event handlers in React are JavaScript functions that run when a specific user interaction occurs.

Example:

```javascript
function handleChange(event) {
  console.log("Input changed:", event.target.value);
}

<input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
```

The function receives a single parameter: the event object.

It's common to use arrow functions or bind methods to preserve `this`.

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Synthetic Event?

React wraps browser events into a SyntheticEvent object to:

- Provide consistent cross-browser behavior
- Improve performance with event pooling
- Allow for a familiar API similar to native DOM events

```javascript
function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevents form refresh
  console.log("Form submitted");
}
```

## ðŸ”¹ React Event Naming Conventions

| Native HTML | React JSX |
|-------------|------------|
| onclick     | onClick    |
| onchange    | onChange   |
| onkeydown   | onKeyDown  |

React uses camelCase for all event names.

The event handler is passed as a function reference, not as a string.

## ðŸ§ª Hands-on Lab Tasks

- Create a button with an onClick event that displays an alert.
- Create a form input that logs the current value using onChange.
- Use `preventDefault()` inside an event handler to stop form submission.
- Explore event object properties like `target`, `type`, and `key`.
